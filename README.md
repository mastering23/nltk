# Intro NLTK ⚗️
-- NLTK, or Natural Language Toolkit, is a Python library designed for natural language processing (NLP). It provides tools and resources for tasks like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning. NLTK also includes corpora and lexical resources, making it a comprehensive platform for working with human language data. It is widely used in research, education, and industry for tasks such as text analysis, sentiment analysis, and language modeling
- Stemming method 🔍
-- in Python, particularly within the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP), refers to the process of reducing words to their root or base form (stem). This technique aims to normalize text data by removing suffixes, prefixes, or inflections, thus grouping related words under a common stem. Stemming is used to simplify text analysis, improve information retrieval accuracy, and reduce the dimensionality of text data

- Lemmatization 🗳️
-- In Python, lemmatization is a process of converting a word to its base or root form, also known as a lemma, which is a dictionary form of the word. Unlike stemming, which simply removes suffixes or prefixes, lemmatization considers the word's context and part of speech to ensure the result is a valid, meaningful dictionary word

- 🛑 Stop Words
  
  -- Words like "a", "the", and "is" appear so often 📚

  --  They're not as important as nouns, verbs, or modifiers 🧠 
 
  --  These are called stop words and are usually filtered out 🧹

  -- 🧾 spaCy includes a built-in list of 326+ English stop words 📘
